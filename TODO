Improvements:
  * make better use of C#/.NET's features, e.g.
    - provide implicit cast operators between ClVariable and ClLinearExpression,
      to eliminate the need for wrapping too much in ClLinearExpressions
    - provide operator overloads for operations on expressions, variables,
      constraints, symbolic weights, etc.
    - use #ifdef for trace and debug modes instead of bool constants
    - use .NET's built-in assert function instead of Cl.Assert
    - let classes such as ClStrength and ClSymbolicWeight implement the
      IComparable interface
  * documentation
    - check for formatting errors
    - complete the documentation
    - generate MSDN style online documentation using NDoc
  * testing
    - unit tests with NUnit
