Bug squashing:
	* provide Cl.PrintHashtable() and Cl.PrintArrayList() methods, and use 
		these instead of their ToString() methods in GetInternalInfo() and other 
		trace prints 

Improvements:
	* make better use of C#/.NET's features, e.g.
		- provide implicit cast operators between ClVariable and ClLinearExpression,
			to eliminate the need for wrapping too much in ClLinearExpressions
		- provide operator overloads for operations on expressions, variables,
		  constraints, symbolic weights, etc.
		- use #ifdef for trace and debug modes instead of bool constants
		- use .NET's built-in assert function instead of Cl.Assert
		- let classes such as ClStrength and ClSymbolicWeight implement the
			IComparable interface
	* documentation
		- check for formatting errors
		- complete the documentation
		- generate MSDN style online documentation using NDoc
	* unit tests with NUnit
