Bug squashing:
	* get LayoutTest.exe working
	* get ClTests.exe working
	* provide Cl.PrintHashtable() and Cl.PrintArrayList() methods, and use 
		these instead of their ToString() methods in GetInternalInfo() en other 
		trace prints 

Improvements:
	* make better use of C#/.NET's features, e.g.
		- use #ifdef for trace and debug modes instead of bool constants
		- provide operator overloads for operations on expressions, variables,
		  constraints, symbolic weights, etc.
		- use .NET's built-in assert function instead of Cl.Assert
	* documentation
		- check for formatting errors
		- complete the documentation
	* unit tests
