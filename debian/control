Description: An incremental constraint solver for .NET
 Cassowary.net is a port of the Cassowary constraint solving toolkit to 
 the .NET platform. It is based on the Java version by Greg J. Badros, which
 in turn is based on the Smalltalk version by Alan Borning.
 .
 Cassowary is an incremental constraint solving toolkit that efficiently solves
 systems of linear equalities and inequalities. Constraints may be either
 requirements or preferences. Client code specifies the constraints to be
 maintained, and the solver updates the constrained variables to have values
 that satisfy the constraints.
