Cassowary.net README
====================

Cassowary.net is a port of the Cassowary constraint solving toolkit [1] to 
the .NET platform. It is based on the Java version by Greg J. Badros,
which in turn is based on the Smalltalk version by Alan Borning.

Context
-------

I originally created this software for my Masters thesis at the University
of Hasselt [2]. More information about my Masters thesis can be found on my
homepage [3].

Dependencies
------------

Cassowary.net only requires a .NET environment, such as the Microsoft .NET 
platform, or the Mono implementation [4]. To compile Cassowary.net with 
parsing support, the (freely available) Coco/R parser generator [5] is 
required.

Acknowledgements
----------------

I would like to thank the people of the Constraints Research Group at the 
University of Washington [6] for their original Cassowary solver.
Special thanks go to Greg J. Badros for taking the time to answer my 
questions and providing useful insights in the behavior of the solver.

Furthermore, I wish to thank Markus LÃ¶berbauer, one of the Coco/R developers,
for helping me correct the constraint grammar.
