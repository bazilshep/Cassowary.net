Notes 
-----

These installation instructions are for UNIX systems.  You will need a
recent version of Mono and the Mono C# compiler. 

In order to compile the constraint parsing library, you need the
Coco/R parser generator. To install Coco/R on Debian or Ubuntu
systems, add this line to your /etc/apt/sources.list:

deb http://www.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at/Research/Projects/Coco/packages ./

Usage
-----
      
To use the library, place it in your project directory and link with
it.
