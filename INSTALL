Notes 
-----

These installation instructions are for UNIX systems.  You will need a
recent version of Mono and the Mono C# compiler. In order to compile
the constraint parsing library, you need the Coco/R parser generator.

Usage
-----
      
To use the library, place it in your project directory and link with
it.

How to build
