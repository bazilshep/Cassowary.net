Note: these installation instructions are for UNIX systems.
      You will need a recent version of Mono and the Mono C# compiler.
      In order to compile the constraint parsing library, you need the
      Coco/R parser generator. 
      
      To use the library, place it in your project directory and link with it.

To build the Cassowary.dll library, just run:

$ make lib

To build ClTests.exe:

$ make cltests

To build LayoutTest.exe:

$ make layout_test

To build all tests:

$ make tests

To build the constraint parsing library (Cassowary.Parsing.dll):

$ make parselib

Or to build both the libraries and the tests, just type:

$ make
