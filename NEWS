0.2.1 -- 2006-02-16:
  * Added debian/ directory, which is used to easily create an Ubuntu
    Breezy package. Contributed by Panagiotis Issaris
    <takis.issaris@uhasselt.be>.

0.2 -- 2005-11-21:
  * Added constraint rule parsing support. Is compiled into new
    Cassowary.Parsing assembly. Generating the parser requires Coco/R.
  * The assemblies are now strongly named by signing them with key
    files.
  * The 'Trace', 'Debug' and 'GC' flags can now be set with properties, and
    are no constants anymore. This eliminates unreachable code
    warnings and improves the quality of the code.

0.1.1 -- 2005-07-31:
  * Trace prints now use Cl.ArrayListToString() and Cl.HashtableToString() 
    methods instead of ArrayList and Hashtable's own ToString()
    methods
  * Added missing constructor ClStayConstraint(ClVariable var)
  * Fixed bug in ClSimplexSolver#InsertErrorVar(...)
  * Added extra constraints to LayoutTest class (to eliminate random
    behavior)
  * Now also compiles on Compact .NET (to do so, define COMPACT
    symbol)

0.1 -- 2005-05-27:
  * Initial release
